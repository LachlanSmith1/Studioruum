Everyone needs to make a powerpoint for their section of the design review and share it by Monday so it can be combined with the other sections. Similarly, you should be able to answer questions on your section and ideally the next week should have quite a bit of talk in the discord. Each powerpoint should last approximatelty five minutes, and we should have a rehersal sorta deal in next week's meeting if it is before the design review.
