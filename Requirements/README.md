Notes
-----
> We want to support flashcards, notes, dictionaries and possibly images/audio files?

> Users will likely be personal, student, teacher and maybe admin?

> An extra feature could be allowing for sharing and online interaction between users?

> We'll use JavaFX for the implementation of the GUI, which should be like swing.
