# Studioruum - Requirements

Information
-----------
The two types of users we want to deal with is Scholars (people who can use their account for personal reasons and to take part in classes) and Educators (people who can create classes which let them share their learning material to multiple people), so we can keep all of our documentation consistent.

Scholars
--------
Create notes(documents), create flashcards, create dictionaries, ask questions (to a public domain), access shared notes (and educator's quizzes).

Educators
---------
This inherits all the attributes that a scholar has, but they can also make classes/groups, publish quizzes and give feedback (marks/reviews) on quiz attempts.

Points
------
Some sort of level system on topics could be implemented in the future, though issues may arise when it comes to similar subjects by different educators and how we categorise peopls#s flashcards/notes/dictionaries (may be better if we don't at all with optional tags).

Notes
-----
> We want to support flashcards, notes, dictionaries and possibly images/audio files?

> Users will likely be personal, student, teacher and maybe admin?

> An extra feature could be allowing for sharing and online interaction between users?

> We'll use JavaFX for the implementation of the GUI, which should be like swing.
